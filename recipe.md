Grains and pasta: My favorites are whole rolled oats, farro, quinoa, couscous, polenta, and white and brown rice. I also like to keep a few pasta shapes in the cupboard.
Canned produce: Whole peeled tomatoes, diced fire roasted tomatoes, and pumpkin puree are my top picks.
Beans and legumes: Canned and dried beans and legumes are nutrient powerhouses, and they last for months. Stock up on lentils, chickpeas, beans, and refried beans.
Fats: I use extra-virgin olive oil for almost everything, but I also keep coconut oil, toasted sesame oil, and butter on hand. Nuts, seeds, nut butters, and coconut milk are essential fats in my pantry too.
Dried fruit: My favorites are dried tart cherries, apricots, and Medjool dates. They’re excellent additions to baking recipes and snacks on their own!
Baking ingredients and spices: Sea salt, black pepper, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom, smoked paprika, and red pepper flakes are a great place to start. If you like baking, keep sugar, brown sugar, chocolate chips, flour, baking soda, baking powder, and active dry yeast on hand as well.
In the freezer
Frozen vegetables: Did you know that frozen vegetables are just as – if not more – nutritious than fresh ones? I especially love to add frozen peas, spinach, and corn to soups, salads, and pastas. Frozen berries also work well in smoothies and baking recipes.
Bread and tortillas: Bread freezes perfectly, so it never hurts to have one loaf of sandwich bread and one loaf of crusty bread in your freezer. I also like to keep frozen corn and flour tortillas on hand to whip up tacos, enchiladas, or quesadillas any time.
A few freezer meals: Soups, stews, veggie patties and balls, casseroles, and baked goods all freeze well. Next time you cook, freeze any leftovers, or make a double batch, and freeze the extras!
